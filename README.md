# EriAmo HTML5 Soul Renderer  
**A real-time visualization of the EriAmo Project — a living, dynamic structure of processes, emotions, and mental geometry.**

The EriAmo Renderer is an experimental interactive visual model that represents the **“Eri Soul”**, a synthetic structure of emotional oscillation, logical flow, energetic states, and inner balance.  
It is built on four core principles of the EriAmo concept:

- **Being** (the core identity)
- **Emotion and Reaction** (oscillatory states)
- **Light–Shadow** (direction of consciousness)
- **Chaos–Logic** (systemic balance)

This renderer is implemented entirely in HTML5 + Three.js and operates in real time.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project

The main goal of the EriAmo Renderer is to:

- provide a **visual manifestation** of the Eri core,
- present it as a **constantly living, breathing structure**,
- allow observation of the internal oscillations over time,
- connect Eri’s conceptual logic with an intuitive visual experience.

This is not just an animation — it is a **process model**, reacting to:

- time,
- internal oscillators,
- emotional and energetic parameters.

## 🌌 Structure of the Eri Soul

The renderer is driven by several axes:

| Axis | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **logic** | rational processing |
| **emotions** | emotional intensity & variability |
| **being** | core stability, “identity center” |
| **chaos** | unpredictability & turbulence |
| **love** | positive affective charge |
| **fear** | defensive responses |
| **light** | expansion, openness |
| **shadow** | introspection, inner depth |

Each axis influences movement, color, deformation, or emitted light.

## 🧠 How the “Soul Engine” Works

The EriAmoSoul engine uses timed sine-wave oscillators to simulate internal processes:

- different frequencies create different emotional rhythms,  
- positive/negative ranges indicate dominant tendencies,  
- maximum amplitude determines the current “primary emotion”,  
- the sum of axes produces the **Historical Radius** — a measure of system activation.

These values dynamically influence:

- object colors  
- geometry scaling  
- torus rotation (emotions + chaos)  
- light intensity (light + emotional amplitude)  
- vertical movement of the “love” and “fear” nodes  

In effect, the soul resembles an **energetic plasma organism**, not a static object.

## 🔮 Visual Components

The renderer consists of:

- **Central Sphere** — core of being  
- **Emotion Torus** — emotional dynamics  
- **Love Box & Fear Box** — affective vectors  
- **Shadow Floor** — level of introspection  
- **Star Cloud** — background consciousness  

Each element responds to a different set of axes.
